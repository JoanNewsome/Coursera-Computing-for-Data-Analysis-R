The function should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the file and the second column is the number of complete cases. A prototype of this function follows\ncomplete <- function(directory, id = 1:332) {\n  ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating\n  ## the location of the CSV files\n  \n  ## 'id' is an integer vector indicating the monitor ID numbers\n  ## to be used\n  \n  ## Return a data frame of the form:\n  ## id nobs\n  ## 1  117\n  ## 2  1041\n  ## ...\n  ## where 'id' is the monitor ID number and 'nobs' is the\n  ## number of complete cases\n}\nYou can see some example output from this function. The function that you write should be able to match this output. Please save your code to a file named complete.R. To run the test script for this part, make sure your working directory has the file complete.R in it and the run\nsource(\"http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compdata/scripts/complete-test.R\")\ncomplete.testscript()",
