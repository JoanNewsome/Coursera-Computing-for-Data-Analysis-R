Programming Assignments:

There will be four programming assignments that will involve writing R code and R functions.
These assignments will allow you to work on your R programming skills and practice writing and debugging code.
For each programming assignment you will be asked to write R code or functions that produce output given a certain input.
Your grade on the assignment will be based on whether the output your function produces matches the correct output.
Details can be found in the descriptions of each programming assignment.
