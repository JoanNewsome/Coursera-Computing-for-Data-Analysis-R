The function should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the file and the second column is the number of complete cases. A prototype of this function follows\ncomplete <- function(directory, id = 1:332){\n  results<-data.frame(id,nobs)\n  for i in id{\n    id <- as.numeric(i)\n    filename <- paste(sprintf(\"%03.f\",id), \"csv\", sep = \".\")\n    path <- paste(directory, filename, sep = \"/\")\n    rbind(data.frame(id=i,nobs=nrow(i))) }}\nYou can see some example output from this function. The function that you write should be able to match this output. Please save your code to a file named complete.R. To run the test script for this part, make sure your working directory has the file complete.R in it and the run\nsource(\"http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/compdata/scripts/complete-test.R\")\ncomplete.testscript()",
